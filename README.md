  ## Description 

  This is a simple coding quiz that references different tenants of JavaScript. Like all web development professionals I have and will have to take more coding quizes. It is a good way to enhance knowledge, as well as test a prospective job applicant. In writing this coding quiz I have learned more about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, particularly the DOM manipulation portion of it. This exercise has shown me a good way to keep sharp and grow my expertise in coding.

  ## *Installation*

  ## Usage
